    <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <p>
        Founded in Johannesburg in 2008, Impilo began as a grassroots initiative led by social workers responding to urgent cases of child abandonment. What started as a small team with big hearts has grown into a nationally recognized nonprofit. Today, we serve thousands of children and families across South Africa, offering adoption services, hunger relief, and emotional support — all rooted in compassion and justice.
      </p>
       <p>
        Impilo was born in 2008 from a moment of heartbreak — a child left at a hospital with no one to claim them. That moment sparked a movement. A small group of social workers, led by Nomsa Dlamini, came together to ensure no child would be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early days, we operated out of a single room in Johannesburg, relying on volunteers and donated supplies. Each child we helped reminded us why we existed: to restore dignity, safety, and hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Impilo grew into a national nonprofit. We expanded our services to include legal advocacy, trauma counseling, adoption support, and hunger relief. But our heart remains the same — every child matters.
